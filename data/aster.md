# ASTER L1T

## Overview

The [ASTER](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/aster) instrument, launched on-board NASA's [Terra](https://terra.nasa.gov/) satellite in 1999, provides multispectral images of the Earth at 15m-90m resolution.  ASTER images provide information about land surface temperature, color, elevation, and mineral composition.

This dataset represents ASTER [L1T](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/ast_l1tv003/) data from 2000-2006.  L1T images have been terrain-corrected and rotated to a north-up UTM projection.  Data are in [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format.

ASTER imagery is currently in preview on Azure; email [`aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com`](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=aster%20question) to request access.


## Storage resources

### Container information

Data are stored in blobs in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://astersa.blob.core.windows.net/aster`


### Scene names

Within the COG container, each scene corresponds to a prefix, named according to:

images/L1T/`[year]`/`[month]`/`[day]`/`[scene name]`

`[year]`, `[month]`, and `[day]` are the four-digit year and two-digit month/day.

`scene name` follows the [ASTER naming convention](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/aster-overview/#aster-naming-conventions):

AST_L1T<span style="background-color:#aaffff;">VVV</span><span style="background-color:#ffaaff;">YYYYMMDHHMMSS</span>_<span style="background-color:#ffffaa;">yyyymmddhhmmss</span>_<span style="background-color:#dddddd;">id</span>

* `VVV` is always "003", for ASTER collection 003
* `MMDDYYYYHHMMSS` is the acquisition month, day, year, hour, minute, second	
* `mmddyyyyhhmmss` is the processing month, day, year, hour, minute, second
* `id` is a unique acquisition identifier.

For example:

`AST_L1T_00306042003004247_20150428235500_35366`

Putting that all together, a complete scene prefix for an ASTER image from June 4, 2003 looks like:

`https://astersa.blob.core.windows.net/aster/images/L1T/2003/06/04/AST_L1T_00306042003004247_20150428235500_35366`


### Image files

All scenes contain one or more of the following files (not all bands are present in all ASTER scenes), separated from the prefix with ".":

* SWIR.tif (ASTER shortwave infrared bands 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; at 30m resolution)
* VNIR.tif (ASTER visible and near-infrared bands 1, 2, and 3; at 15m resolution)
* TIR.tif (ASTER thermal infrared bands 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14; at 90m resolution)

So, for example, the VNIR COG file for the example scene above is available at:

https://astersa.blob.core.windows.net/aster/images/L1T/2003/06/04/AST_L1T_00306042003004247_20150428235500_35366.VNIR.tif


## Authentication

We also provide a read-only SAS (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">shared access signature</a>) token to allow access to NAIP data via, e.g., BlobFuse, which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`?sv=2020-04-08&si=aster-ro&sr=c&sig=sXo9shWJec3H6ezpLPuYo7gVpM%2Bj0jLL0fa7jv%2FUe1M%3D`

Mounting instructions for Linux are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux).


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting ASTER data - using the NASA CMR API to query for scenes of interest - is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](aster.ipynb).


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure region, where the images are stored.  If you are using ASTER data for environmental science applications, consider applying for an [AI for Earth grant](http://aka.ms/ai4egrants) to support your compute requirements.
