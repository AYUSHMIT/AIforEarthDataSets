# Deltares Global Flood Map

## Overview

[Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/en/) has produced inundation maps of flood
depth using a geographic information system-based inundation model that takes
into account water level attenuation and is forced by sea level. At the
coastline, the model is forced by extreme water levels containing surge and tide
from GTSMip6. The water level at the coastline is extended landwards to all
areas that are hydrodynamically connected to the coast following a ‘bathtub’
like approach and calculates the flood depth as the difference between the water
level and the topography. Unlike a simple ‘bathtub’ model, this model attenuates
the water level over land with a maximum attenuation factor of 0.5 m km-1
consistent with other studies (Vafeidis et al., 2018). The attenuation factor
simulates the dampening of the flood levels due to the roughness over land.  In
its current version, the model does not account for varying roughness over land
and permanent water bodies such as rivers and lakes.

The model does not account for the compound effects of waves, rainfall and river
discharge on coastal flooding. It also does not include the mitigating effect of
coastal flood protection. Flood extents must thus be interpreted as the area
that is potentially exposed to flooding without coastal protection.

## Storage resources

Data are stored in netCDF files in Azure Blob Storage in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

<https://deltaresfloodssa.blob.core.windows.net/floods/Final%20dataset%20June%202021/>

Within that container, data are organized under several directories representing covered regions:

### Global datasets

There are multiple global flood datasets derived from different DEMs and at different resolutions. Not all DEMs have all resolutions:

`NASA` and `MERIT` are available at `90m` and `1km` resolutions using the following directory structure:

`global/[DEM]/[resolution]/delivery_[resolution]/`

`LIDAR` is available at `5km` resolution, using the following directory structure:

`global/[DEM]/[resolution]/v02/`

Within those directories, all files follow the same naming convention:

`GFM_global_[DEM][resolution]_[sealevelyear]slr_rp[returnperiod]_masked.nc`

...for example

`GFM_global_MERIT1km_2050slr_rp0050.nc`

Valid return periods are: `0000`, `0002`, `0005`, `0010`, `0025`, `0050`, `0100`, `0250`.

Valid sea level years are: `2018` and `2050`.

For example, a 100 year return period based off of current conditions (2018), derived from NASA DEM at 90m resolution would be accessed at:

`/floods/Final dataset June 2021/global/NASA/90m/delivery_90m/GFM_global_NASADEM90m_2018slr_rp0100_masked.nc`

### Historic event datasets

Also included in the `floods` directory are historical storm event data files that follow similar DEM and resolution conventions. Not all storms are available for each DEM and resolution combination, but generally follow the format of:

`[DEM]_[resolution]-wm_final/[storm_name]_[event_year]_masked.nc`

...for example:

`/floods/Final dataset June 2021/MERIT_90m-wm_final/Omar_2008_masked.nc`

### File contents

Both global and historical storm event netCDF files have the same attributes and follow CF-1.6 conventions:
