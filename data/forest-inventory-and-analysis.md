# Forest Inventory and Analysis

## Overview

Status and trends on U.S. forest location, health, growth, mortality, and production, from the US Forest Service's  [Forest Inventory and Analysis](https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/) (FIA) program.

The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset is a nationwide survey of the forest assets of the United States. The FIA research program has been in existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and use of trees on the nation's forest land.

Domain: continental U.S., 1928-2018

Resolution: plot-level (irregular polygon)

This dataset was curated and brought to Azure by [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/).


## Storage resources

Data are stored in blob storage in the West Europe Azure region, in the following folder:

`https://cpdataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/cpdata/raw/fia`

Data are stored in [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format.  Within the above folder, data are organized according to:

`/[table].parquet`

`table` is one of the FIA tables:

- boundary
- cond
- cond_dwm_calc
- county
- dwm_coarse_woody_debris
- dwm_duff_litter_fuel
- dwm_fine_woody_debris
- dwm_microplot_fuel
- dwm_residual_pile
- dwm_transect_segment
- dwm_visit
- grnd_cvr
- invasive_subplot_spp

- veg_visit

We also provide a read-only SAS (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">shared access signature</a>) token to allow access to this data via, e.g., BlobFuse, which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`?sv=2019-12-12&si=cpdata-ro&sr=c&sig=tqRGrmdYYa9WYkaPi0wWOD0nalRdNGTZNe97GL2enDA%3D`

Mounting instructions for Linux are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux).

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure data center, where the data are stored.  If you are using this data for environmental science applications, consider applying for an [AI for Earth grant](http://aka.ms/ai4egrants) to support your compute requirements.


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting FIA data is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/forest-inventory-and-analysis.ipynb).
