# Esri 10-meter Land Cover

## Overview

Global estimates of 10-class land use/land cover (LULC) for 2020, derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. This dataset was generated by [Impact Observatory](https://impactobservatory.com), who used billions of human-labeled pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model for land classification. The global map was produced by applying this model to the Sentinel-2 2020 scene collection on the Planetary Computer.

This dataset is also available on the [ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcover/).

## Storage resources

Data are stored as cloud-optimized GeoTIFF images in Blob Storage in the West Europe Azure region, in the following folder:

`https://ai4edataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/io-lulc/io-lulc-model-001-v01-composite-v03-supercell-v02-clip-v01/`

Within that folder, files are named according to:

`[gzd]_[start-date]_[end-date].tif`

* `gzd` is a three-character [MGRS grid zone designator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System#Grid_zone_designation)
* For all images presently available (for the 2020 land cover map), `start-date` is "20200101" and `end-date` is "20210101"

For example, Auckland is in MRGS zone 60H, so the following tile includes land cover information for Auckland:

`https://ai4edataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/io-lulc/io-lulc-model-001-v01-composite-v03-supercell-v02-clip-v01/60H_20200101-20210101.tif`

Tiles closely approximate areas corresponding to MGRS three-character prefixes, but deviate slightly to allow some overlap between images and to wrap tightly to coastlines.  Precise geometry for all tiles is available <a href="https://ai4edataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/io-lulc/io-lulc-model-001-v01-composite-v03-supercell-v02-clip-v01.geojson">here</a> (geojson).


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting land cover data is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](io-lulc.ipynb).


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure region, where the images are stored.  If you are using land cover data for conservation applications, consider applying for an [AI for Earth grant](http://aka.ms/ai4egrants) to support your compute requirements.

<span style='font-size:80%'>Land cover classification near... actually, the geographic location of this region is a mystery even to us (it looked nice, and we grabbed a screenshot), so if you can identify it, [email us](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=io-lulc%20question)!</span>
