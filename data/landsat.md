### Landsat Collection 2 Level-2

#### Overview

The [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) program provides the longest continuous space-based record of Earth’s land in existence.  

This dataset represents the global archive of Level-2 Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 from Landsat Collection 2.  Because there is some latency before Level-2 data is available, a rolling window of recent Level-1 data is available as well.  All images are in Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF format.

Landsat imagery is currently in preview on Azure; email [`aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com`](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=landsat%20question) to request access.

#### Storage resources

##### Container information

Data are stored in blobs in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://landsateuwest.blob.core.windows.net/landsat-c2`

As per above, this container is not world-readable; email [`aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com`](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=landsat%20question) to request an access token.

##### Scene names

Within that container, each scene corresponds to a folder, named according to:

`[level]`/standard/`[sensor]`/`[year]`/`[path]`/`[row]`/[scene name]`

* `[level]` is "level-1" or "level-2"
* `[sensor]` is "oli-tirs" (Landsat 8), "etm" (Landsat 7), or "tm" (Landsat 4/5)
* `[year]` is a four-digit year
* `[path]` and `[row]` are three-digit codes representing path/row coordinates in the [Landsat Worldwide Reference System](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/worldwide-reference-system)

`scene name` follows the [Landsat Collection 2 scene name convention](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-naming-convention-landsat-collection-2-level-1-and-level-2-scenes?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products):

`LXSS_LLLL_PPPRRR_YYYYMMDD_yyyymmdd_CC_TX`

* `L` is always "L" for "Landsat"
* `X` is a sensor identifier ("C" for OLI/TIRS combined, "O" for OLI-only, "T" for TIRS-only, "E" for ETM+, "T" for TM, or "M" for MSS)
* `SS` is a satellite identifier ("04", "05", "07", or "08")
* `LLL` is a [processing correction level](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-levels-processing) (L1TP/L1GT/L1GS for level-1 data, L2SP/L2SR for level-2 data)
* `PPP` is a [WRS](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/worldwide-reference-system) path
* `RRR` is a [WRS](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/worldwide-reference-system) row
* `YYYYMMDD` is the acquisition year, month, day
* `yyyymmdd` is the processing year, month, day
* `CC` is the collection number (always "02" in this dataset)
* `TX`is the [collection category](https://www.usgs.gov/media/videos/landsat-collections-what-are-tiers) ("RT" for real-time, "T1" for tier 1, or "T2" for tier 2)

Putting that all together, a complete scene folder for a Landsat 8 image from February 8, 2020 looks like:

`https://landsateuwest.blob.core.windows.net/landsat-c2/level-2/standard/oli-tirs/2020/011/021/LC08_L2SP_011021_20200208_20200823_02_T1/`

##### Landsat 8 image files

Within a Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) scene folder, listing *.tif will enumerate all images, with suffixes indicating bands according to the following:

* `B1`: Band 1 Visible (0.43-0.45 µm) 30 m
* `B2`: Band 2 Visible (0.450-0.51 µm) 30 m
* `B3`: Band 3 Visible (0.53-0.59 µm) 30 m
* `B4`: Band 4 Red (0.64-0.67 µm) 30 m
* `B5`: Band 5 Near-Infrared (0.85-0.88 µm) 30 m
* `B6`: Band 6 SWIR 1(1.57-1.65 µm) 30 m
* `B7`: Band 7 SWIR 2 (2.11-2.29 µm) 30 m
* `B8`: Band 8 Panchromatic (PAN) (0.50-0.68 µm) 15 m
* `B10`: Band 10 TIRS 1 (10.6-11.19 µm) 100 m

* `B9`: Band 9 Cirrus (1.36-1.38 um) 30m (level-1 data only)
* `B11`: Band 11 TIRS 2 (11.50-12.51 µm) 100m (level-1 data only)

For example, the band 2 image in the example scene above is at:

`https://landsateuwest.blob.core.windows.net/landsat-c2/level-2/standard/oli-tirs/2020/011/021/LC08_L2SP_011021_20200615_20200823_02_T2/LC08_L2SP_011021_20200615_20200823_02_T2_SR_B2.TIF`

#### Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting Landsat data - using the NASA CMR API to query for scenes of interest - is available in the notebook provided under the &ldquo;data access&rdquo; link.


#### Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure region, where the images are stored.  If you are using Landsat data for environmental science applications, consider applying for an [AI for Earth grant](http://aka.ms/ai4egrants) to support your compute requirements.
