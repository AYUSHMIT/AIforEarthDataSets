# MODIS

## Overview

Satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).

[MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) provides Earth observation data in a wide spectral range, from 1999 to the present.  The MODIS satellites image the Earth every one to two days, though individual products derived from MODIS data may have lower temporal resolutions.  MODIS is administered by the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/) (NASA) and the [US Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) (USGS).

<b>This data set is in a temporary format and location; data are being converted to cloud-optimized GeoTIFF and moved to the West Europe Azure region.</b>

## Storage resources

Data are stored in blobs in the East US data center (re-locating to West Europe in mid-2021), in the following blob container:

`https://modissa.blob.core.windows.net/modis-006`

Within that container, data are organized according to:

`[product]/[htile]/[vtile]/[daynum]/[filename]`

`product` is the MODIS product name; currently `MCD43A4` is available on Azure.

`htile` and `vtile` refer to tile numbers in the [MODIS sinusoidal grid system](https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html).  The notebook available under &ldquo;Data Access&rdquo; demonstrates one way to map latitude and longitude into this grid system.

`daynum` is a four-digit year plus a three-digit day of year (from 001 to 365), e.g. `2019001` represents January 1, 2019.

...for example, the folder:

`MCD43A4/00/08/2019001`

...contains images from Jan 1, 2019.

Images are stored in HDF format (converting to cloud-optimized GeoTIFF in mid-2021).  The mapping from channels to spectral bands is product-specific; for MCD43A4, for example, mappings are available [here](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd43a4v006/).

For example, the file:

`MCD43A4/00/08/2019001/MCD43A4.A2019001.h00v08.006.2019010201703.hdf`

...contains the MODIS scene from htile 00, vtile 08, on January 1, 2019.

We also provide a read-only SAS (shared access signature) token to allow access to MODIS data via, e.g., BlobFuse, which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`?sv=2019-12-12&si=modis-ro&sr=c&sig=jauBgV7FNXyhbjO60XSMr6AnFFd5sl%2BwXsNazkOOFjs%3D`

Mounting instructions for Linux are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux).

MODIS data can consume hundreds of terabytes, so large-scale processing is best performed in the East US Azure data center, where the images are stored.  If you are using MODIS data for environmental science applications, consider applying for an [AI for Earth grant](http://aka.ms/ai4egrants) to support your compute requirements.
