# NASADEM

## Overview

Global topographic information from the NASADEM program.

[NASADEM](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/measures/nasadem) provides global topographic data at 1 arc-second (~30m) horizontal resolution, derived primarily from data captured via the [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) (SRTM).

NASADEM is available in both NetCDF and cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format.

COG files were acquired via [OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/), supported by the National Science Foundation under award numbers 1948997, 1948994 & 1948857.


## Storage resources

### COG files

Data are stored in blobs in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://nasademeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/nasadem-cog`

Within that container, data are organized according to:

`v001/NASADEM_HGT_[lat_tile][lon_tile].tif`

`lat_tile` is a character ('n' or 's') plus a two-digit latitude value, derived from the latitude represented by each tile.  To find the latitude code for a given latitude, perform a floor() operation, then take the absolute value, then prefix with 'n' for positive latitudes (including zero) and 's' for negative latitudes, and zero-pad to two digits.  For example, the latitude 35.3606 becomes 'n35'.

`lon_tile` is a character ('e' or 'w') plus a three-digit longitude value, derived from the longitude represented by each tile.  To find the longitude code for a given longitude, perform a floor() operation, then take the absolute value, then prefix with 'e' for positive latitudes (including zero) and 'w' for negative latitudes, and zero-pad to three digits.  For example, the longitude 138.72 becomes 'e138'.

Images in this container are stored in [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format.

We also provide a read-only SAS (shared access signature) token to allow access to NASADEM data via, e.g., BlobFuse, which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`?sv=2020-04-08&si=nasadem-cog-ro&sr=c&sig=RkEC4wi6sOdMEP6uj59wocpwiE4%2BBwrjt5qn5lEFov8%3D`

A full list of COG files is available [here](https://nasademeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/nasadem-cog/v001/index/nasadem_cog_list.txt).


### NetCDF files

Data are stored in blobs in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://nasademeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/nasadem-nc`

Within that container, data are organized according to:

`v001/NASADEM_NC_[lat_tile][lon_tile].[extension]`

`lat_tile` and `lon_tile` are as per above.

For each tile, filenames with three extensions are present:

* 1.jpg (a preview image)
* nc (the data itself)
* nc.xml (tile creation metadata)

Images in this container are stored in [NetCDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF) format.

We also provide a read-only SAS (shared access signature) token to allow access to NASADEM data via, e.g., BlobFuse, which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`?sv=2019-12-12&si=nasadem-ro&sr=c&sig=6rAbZIvIjQVTov2bGUpqH9T0fzTipRahkooOSf2XCuo%3D`

A full list of NetCDF files is available [here](https://nasademeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/nasadem-nc/v001/index/nasadem_file_list.txt).


## Other storage notes

Mounting instructions for Linux are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux).

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure data center, where the images are stored.  If you are using NASADEM data for environmental science applications, consider applying for an [AI for Earth grant](http://aka.ms/ai4egrants) to support your compute requirements.
