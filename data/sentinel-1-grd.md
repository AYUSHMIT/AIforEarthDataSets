# Sentinel-1 GRD

## Overview

The [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) program provides global synthetic aperature radar imaging with a revisit time of approximately six days.  The [Ground Range Detected](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-1-sar/products-algorithms/level-1-algorithms/ground-range-detected) (GRD) product has been detected and projected to ground range.

This dataset represents the global Sentinel-1 GRD archive, from 2017 to the present, converted to [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format.

Sentinel-1 data on Azure are maintained by [Sinergise](https://sinergise.com/).

Sentinel-1 GRD imagery is currently in preview on Azure; email [`aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com`](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=sentinel1%20question) to request access.


## Storage resources

### Container information

Data are stored in blobs in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://sentinel1euwest.blob.core.windows.net/s1-grd`


### Scene names

Within that container, each scene corresponds to a folder, named according to:

`GRD/[year]/[month]/[day]/[acquisition-mode]/[polarization]/[scene_name]`

* `year` is a four-digit year
* `month` is the 1-indexed, non-zero-padded month
* `day` is the 1-indexed, non-zero-padded day
* `acquisition-mode` is the [acquisition mode](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/acquisition-modes) for this scene, one of IW (interferometric wide swath), SM (stripmap), EW (extra-wide swath), or WV (wave)
* `polarization` is the [polarization mode](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/product-overview/polarimetry) for this scene, typically one of SH (single HH), SV (single VV), DH (dual HH+HV), or DV (dual VV+VH); HH, HV, VV, and VH also occur

`scene name` follows the [Sentinel-1 scene name convention](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-1-sar/products-algorithms/level-1-product-formatting):

`MMM_BB_TTTR_LFPP_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_YYYYMMDDYHHMMSS_OOOOOO_DDDDDD_CCCC`

* `MMM` is satellite (S1A or S1B)
* `BB` is the acquisition mode
* `TTT` is the product type (always `GRD` in this data set)
* `L` is the processing level (always `1` in this data set)
* `F` is the product class (always `S` (for "SAR standard") in this dataset)
* `PP` is the polarization (SH, SV, DH, DV, HH, HV, VV, or VH)
* `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS` is the scene start and stop capture time
* `OOOOOO` is an absolute orbit number
* `DDDDDD` is the "mission data take identifier" 
* `CCCC` is a checksum

Putting that all together, a complete scene folder looks like:

`https://sentinel1euwest.blob.core.windows.net/s1-grd/GRD/2021/1/29/IW/DV/S1B_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20210129T020125_20210129T020150_025363_030553_F429`

### Image files

Within a scene folder, recursively listing *.tiff will enumerate all images; all of these files will be within the `measurement` folder.  For example, for an IW-mode, DV-polarized image:

* `measurement/iw-vh.tiff`
* `measurement/iw-vv.tiff`

For example, the iw-vh image for the example scene above is at:

`https://sentinel1euwest.blob.core.windows.net/s1-grd/GRD/2021/1/29/IW/DV/S1B_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20210129T020125_20210129T020150_025363_030553_F429/measurement/iw-vh.tiff`

### Metadata files

Metadata files follow the [Sentinel-1 product specification](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/document-library/-/asset_publisher/1dO7RF5fJMbd/content/sentinel-1-product-specification); see the specification for complete documentation of both data and metadata.

This section will provide a short summary of each file within each scene folder.

* `manifest.safe`: index file listing all files in this scene and their checksums... basically the machine-readable version of this section of the documentation.
* `productInfo.json`: .json-formatted scene metadata, with footprint information and a list of available files
* `preview/product-preview.html`: index file listing all files in this scene, along with a thumbnail
* `preview/quick-look.png`: a handy thumbnail for this scene
* `preview/map-overlay.html`: kml-formatted scene footprint
* `annotation/*.xml`: metadata associated with the GRD production (detection, projection)


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting Sentinel-1 GRD data - using the Copernicus Open Access Hub API to query for scenes of interest - is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](sentinel-1-grd.ipynb).


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure region, where the images are stored.  If you are using Sentinel-1 data for environmental science applications, consider applying for an [AI for Earth grant](http://aka.ms/ai4egrants) to support your compute requirements.
