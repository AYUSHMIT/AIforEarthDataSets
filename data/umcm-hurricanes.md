# University of Miami Coupled Model (UMCM) for Hurricanes Ike and Sandy

## Overview

The University of Miami Coupled Model (UMCM) is a coupled model that integrates atmospheric, wave, and ocean components to produce wind, wave, and current data. Atmospheric data is produced using the [Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) model (WRF), wave data is produced using the [University of Miami Wave Model](https://umwm.org/) (UMWM), and ocean current data is produced using the
[Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model](https://www.hycom.org/) (HYCOM).

The model was used to study offshore wind conditions during [Hurricane Ike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Ike) and [Hurricane Sandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy); this dataset - provided by the [Open Energy Data Initiative](https://openei.org/wiki/Open_Energy_Data_Initiative_(OEDI)) (OEDI) - represents the output of that modeling run.

## Model information

The time resolution for each model run is as follows:

* Hurricane Ike
  * 1 sample/hour from 9/8/2008 12:00:00 UTC to 9/12/2008 6:00:00 UTC
  * 1 sample/10 minutes from 9/12/2008 6:00:00 UTC to 9/13/2008 9:00:00 UTC
* Hurricane Sandy
  * 1 sample/10 minutes from 10/28/2012 00:10:00 UTC to 10/31/2012 00:00:00 UTC

The following variables were extracted from the HYCOM model:

* bathymetry
* ocean_mixed_layer_thickness-ilt
* ocean_mixed_layer_thickness-mlt
* sea_water_potential_density at all depths
* sea_water_salinity at all depths
* sea_surface_elevation
* eastward_sea_water_velocity
* northward_sea_water_velocity
* upward_sea_water_velocity
* sea_water_temperature
* depth

## Storage resources

The UMCM data is stored in HDF format in Azure Blob Storage in the East US Azure region, in the following folder:

`https://nrel.blob.core.windows.net/oedi/umcm/`

The primary files, containing temporally and spatially coherent time-series data for each hurricane are:

* <https://nrel.blob.core.windows.net/oedi/umcm/ike.h5> (for Hurricane Ike)
* <https://nrel.blob.core.windows.net/oedi/umcm/sandy.h5> (for Hurricane Sandy)

Raw output from the HYCOM, UMWM, and WRF models are available in the folders:

`https://nrel.blob.core.windows.net/oedi/umcm/[hurricane]/[model]`

* `hurricane` is one of "ike" or "sandy"
* `model` is one of "hycom", "umwm", or "wrf"

## Data Format

The UMCM data is stored in HDF datasets by variable and depth (when available).  Each dataset is composed of a 3D data cube with dimensions (time, latitude, longitude). The positional values of each dimension are available in the datasets:

* `time_index`
* `latitude`
* `longitude`

Additional location metadata is available in the `meta` table.

## Mounting the container

We also provide an API to get read-only SAS (shared access signature) tokens to allow access via, e.g., [BlobFuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse), which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/sas/v1/token/nrel/oedi`

API documentation is at `https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/sas/v1/docs`.
